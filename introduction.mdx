## Problem - Interactions in Crypto is Difficult

While building blockchains is becoming more efficient and effective, it often results in a degraded user experience.

1. **Broken UX:** The surge of blockchains has led to a **repetitive and confusing user experience** due to limited interoperability.
2. **Expensive:** Users face **considerable costs when swapping tokens or bridging assets** across multiple chains.
3. **Fragmented:** **Managing assets across several chains and tokens** poses a significant challenge for both users and service providers, leading to inefficiency and complexity.

## Our Solution, SILK

SILK enhances the ease of interaction with other blockchains, whether it involves purchasing ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, or making deposits to generate returns. The environment SILK provides focuses on receiving requests, finding the most effective route, and resolving the request. From day one, users can interact with dapps on other chains, and dapps can tap into the vast user and asset base on these chains.

Contracts and modules can be deployed permissionlessly on any EVM chains, with the solver facilitating the execution and token transfer.
